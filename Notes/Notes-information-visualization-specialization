# Notes on Information visualization: Programming with D3.js

D3 is most often used in web applications, but can also be used for mobile platforms or desktop platforms.
D3 is about creating _interactive_ visualizations. D3 is based on html, css and JavaScript. This course talks about:

- D3 basics (html, css and JavaScript)
- drawing lines and arcs
- drawing maps
- drawing networks
- interactivity

##1. Introduction to Html
Html is the language used to create structure on a page. We have different languages on a web platform (css for structure, JavaScript for interaction 
and adding changes to the page), but Html is the core.
To make html objects, we use html tags <>. You can create a hierarchy of tags. Each tag also has attributes. Each tag adds information to a tag.
Html does not define what things look like, but what they are. 
You can also use html to let the user input information. 

##2. Introduction to Css
Css is used to add style to a page. Css uses the selector to define what html tag we want to change. Then, inside
the select we can define as many properties as we want. For css, you can have classes (for multiple elements) and id's (for single elements)
You can use it to change style when hovering over a tag. Style can be added on the top of the html file, inline, or in a separate css file.
